# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- Use AuthController as the correct controller name throughout the project; replace any references to UserController with AuthController.
- Use British English spelling throughout the codebase (e.g., "Initialises" not "Initializes", "Authorise" not "Authorize").

## Code Style
- Follow naming conventions consistently across the project.
